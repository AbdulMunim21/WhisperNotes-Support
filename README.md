🧠 What is WhisperNotes?
WhisperNotes is a simple, secure note-taking app that keeps your notes offline by default, with the exception of the meeting summarization feature, which uses an API to generate concise summaries.

✍️ Key Features
🔐 Private Local Notes
All notes are stored only on your device.

No cloud syncing. No trackers. No ads.

📝 Meeting Summarization (via API)
Record or paste meeting transcripts.

Summaries are generated using a secure API call to a trusted external service.

Transcripts are not stored and are processed only temporarily to return the summary.

🔒 We do not associate any personal information with the transcript.

🗂️ Notes Categories
Create and organize notes into categories (e.g. Personal, Work, Tasks, Ideas).

Filter and view notes by category to keep things tidy.

Perfect for users who prefer structured organization.
